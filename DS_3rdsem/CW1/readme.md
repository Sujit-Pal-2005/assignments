## Statement
Implement the following in C and submit  a doc file with all the c programs in one file to classroom .
### Problem 1
 Write a program that generates n integer random numbers between a given range low to high.

**Input**
```
Enter n:20
Enter low and high range :1 1000
```
**Output**
```
Random numbers are : 16 302 62 858 192 857 444 408 255 844 721 980 2 922 42 497 757 128 974 33 
```

### Note:
 Use rand() function of c

### Problem 2
 Given n as input, write a program to print the nth Fibonacci Number, both recursively anditeratively.
Output: In recursive implementation, count and print the number of recursive calls as follows: Let fib(0) = 0 and fib(1) = 1;

**Input**
```
Enter n:6
Enter 1 for iteration and any number without 1 for recursion:2
```
**Output**
```
6 th fibonacci number by recursion is :8
Fib(0) is called:5
Fib(1) is called:8
Fib(2) is called:5
Fib(3) is called:3
Fib(4) is called:2
Fib(5) is called:1
Fib(6) is called:1
Total recursion called :25
