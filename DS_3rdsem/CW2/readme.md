## Statement
Write a c program to implement Insertion sort.
(Refer to the Slides for algorithm )
Input: The number of elements to be sorted n
### Note:
1.You should generate n random numbers using your own program as a function.
2. Run your program for n = 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 20000, 40000, 50000 
3. Write a function to verify if numbers are indeed sorted. 
3. For each run, count the number of comparisons. Make a table in doc /xls file with columns, n and number of comparisons in each case. Plot a graph of n vs # of comparisons.

**Input**
```
Enter number of element: 1000
```
**Output**
```
It is not sorted
Number of comparisons: 259180
Now it is sorted
```
